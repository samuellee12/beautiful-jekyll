### My story

Tinkering with my toys as a child led me to work on hands on projects as a high schooler, eventually leading me to completing my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at The Cooper Union in NYC. Through coursework and summer experiences, I have gained much interest in the field of aerospace engineering, especially in simulation and modeling. I spent two years working on propulsion components (pumps and other miscellaneous components) at Newport News Shipbuilding before starting a PhD at University of Maryland, College Park.
